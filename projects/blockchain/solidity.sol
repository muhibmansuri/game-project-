# // A simple smart contract example in Solidity
# contract SimpleStorage {
#     uint256 private storedData;

#     // Function to set the value of storedData
#     function set(uint256 x) public {
#         storedData = x;
#     }

#     // Function to get the value of storedData
#     function get() public view returns (uint256) {
#         return storedData;
#     }
# }

# // This contract allows users to store and retrieve a single unsigned integer value.
# // The `set` function updates the value, while the `get` function retrieves it.
# // This is a basic example to illustrate Solidity syntax and smart contract functionality.
